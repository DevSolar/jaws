\section{Introduction}

This Developer Guide is intended to provide developers with the necessary
background information, so that bugs can be quickly traced to their source,
expansions be implemented without breaking the established architecture,
and new developers get up to speed with a minimum of head scratching and
trial \& error. % Note how & must be escaped in text.
